ISSUES:
- Tx, SetupMetaData.rx_available:
  seems to be ok currently, but can it be even better?
  should introduce .rx_available and .rx_valid !?!

- we should take into account in rssi scaling a LNA as well as the db min for a board & setting

- setup: which are effective only on restart? which on-the-fly?
- work out what to do if FrequencyBand_allowed_mask, Mode_allowed_mask are different for Rx and Tx (which should not happen)?
  This holds for common parameters. It should work such, that the Tx only provides options also allowed by the Rx.
- work out how to go with setup layout changes

- EVERY tx module needs a means to set the parameters, via SWD?

- restart: we do not want to go through waiting for sx and testing their presence
- for dual sx avoid that both sx.Init wait 300ms
- allow a missing 2nd sx for diversity boards

- CRSF baro alt item, can we add more of our own?

- rx R9MM R9MX, why buzzer behaves different for R9MX?

- don't allow bind, save, reload, param changes, etc, when vehicle is armed/flying
  => this requires the tx&rx to know if the vehicle is in this state
  that's possible for when MAVLink mode is used, but else?
  => two bits, one to indicate available, one to indicate armed/disarmed
  do it on rx side by parsing MAVLink, most robust
- don't allow bind, save, reload, param changes, etc, when connection is too weak, e.g. rssi too low

- buzzer: work out what to do to account for active-low and active-high, so that buzzer isn't permanently "on"

- factory reset


The 3 MAIN topics TODO:

1) Link
- AFC
- reconnect by choosing frequency based on rssi map

2) Parameters, usability
- firmware update: via connection to USB on tx module, for receiver ota-passthrough

3) Auxiliary features
- relay setup, how can this be done? https://github.com/olliw42/mLRS/pull/123
- 2.4 GHz high-interference mode bw 400kHz, at least for experiment to evaluate
- beacon mode
- should we do LoRa packets with header len enabled?


TODO:
- effect of USE_REGULATOR_MODE_DCDC? where to place it??


Longterm TODO:
- support high_latency2

- when we eventually do OTA update of the rx, the rx firmware must be universal in the sense that it supports all possible
  rx boards. Gladly, rx modules are relatively simple. But: Craft a concept which hopefully will last for a long time.
  It won't work for different hardware platforms!?
  Ultimately I think it should be all G4
  alternatively: the receiver is not automatically updated together with the tx, but simply through the tx module
  yes, that's in view of the growing targets the only way to go, and it is sufficiently user friendly
